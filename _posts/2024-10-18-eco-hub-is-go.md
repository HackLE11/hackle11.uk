## Introducing Charnwood Eco Hub

The Loughborough hackspace / makerspace project is being taken forward by Charnwood Eco Hub, a new not-for-profit shared community hub based in Loughborough. The Eco Hub aims to provide a space to meet, make, fix, create and share sustainable ideas and resources.

We're really grateful to our friends at [SOFA](https://sofareuse.org) for making space available in their building for the Eco Hub. SOFA is a Registered Charity set up in 1981 to provide affordable re-used furniture, electrical appliances and household goods.
